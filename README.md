# Ethical Hacking Project - Sapienza University

As part of my Ethical Hacking course at Sapienza University, this project consists of two phases:

## Phase 1: Designing a Vulnerable VM

In Phase 1, we designed a vulnerable VM based on Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS. This VM includes multiple deliberately introduced vulnerabilities, allowing pentesters to gain initial access through services and then escalate their privileges to root. The difficulty of these vulnerabilities ranges from easy to hard.

You can explore the VM here: [Download Vulnerable VM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OQ_zMA5PGk_RVg0Ip6jzZTEEWVw7TJNO/view)

## Phase 2: Penetration Testing Another Group's VM

Phase 2 involved penetration testing a VM created by another group. We successfully identified and exploited the vulnerabilities to gain root access, providing a comprehensive analysis in our report.
